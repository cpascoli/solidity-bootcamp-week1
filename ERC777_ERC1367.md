# ERC777 & ERC1363 standards

ERC777 defines an expension for ERC20 tokens that introduces operators that can send tokens on behalf of another address (holder contract or regular account) and send/receive hooks. 
ERC777 requires a unique registry, where any address can register the addresses of contracts implementing the hooks (ERC-820, ERC-1820).

ERC1363 defines an interface for ERC20 tokens that supports executing recipient code after `transfer` or `transferFrom`, or spender code after `approve`.
Contracts that want to support ERC1363 tokens are required to implement `ERC1363Receiver` and  `ERC1363Spender` interfaces.


## What problems ERC777 and ERC1363 solve?
- ERC777 and ERC1363 address the inability to execute custom code after a ERC-20 transfer or approval.
- One of the primary reasons for the existence of ERC777, ERC1363 is to prevent tokens being sent to contracts that do not know what to do with them, especially non-proxied contracts that cannot be modified (because it causes any received tokens to be lost forever).
- ERC777 also addesses the issue with ERC20 tokens that requires a 2-step `approve` & `transferFrom` workflow to allow a contract to receive and process ERC20 tokens.
- These standards also allow contract wallets to reject spam tokens (at least in principle).


## Why was ERC1363 introduced?
- ERC1363 (and ERC4524) where introduced to address the issues of ERC777.
- ERC777 (and ERC4524) transparently degrade to a standard ERC20 transfer when sending to an EOA. ERC1363 doesn't allow that, so it's technically the strongest of all three standards in terms of guaranteeing that you're only sending to the desired address.


## What issues are there with ERC777?

- ERC777 does not follow the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, the sender notification interface is called before state is updated, which opens up the issue of reentrancy attacks for ERC777 tokens transfers similar to ETH transfers.
- Over engineered, introduces bad abstractions to rely on, and requires very important checks to be implemented by every integrator.
- The fallback function feature of Solidity actually breaks the ERC777 standard, for improperly implemented receivers. This can happen when the receiver notification hook is incorrectly specified in the ERC1820 registry, the fallback function of the receiver is called instead, and such fallback function doesn't revert.
